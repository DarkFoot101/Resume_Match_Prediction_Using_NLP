Description:
Developed a robust web application that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate and streamline the resume screening process for recruiters. 
The system allows uploading hundreds of resumes at once and matches them against a specific job description to identify the most suitable candidates. Key features of the project include:

Keyword Extraction: Utilized advanced NLP techniques to extract essential skills, qualifications, and experiences from resumes.
Semantic Analysis: Implemented algorithms to compare resumes with job descriptions based on semantic relevance rather than simple keyword matching.
Custom Scoring Model: Designed a scoring mechanism to rank resumes based on alignment with the job role requirements.
Batch Processing: Supported large-scale resume uploads for efficient processing and filtering.
Interactive Web Interface: Built an intuitive web application for recruiters to upload resumes, input job descriptions, and view ranked results.
Tech Stack: Python (Backend) , Streamlit (Frontend) NLP Technology.
Provides an alternative to the tradtional Machine Learning techniques used in filtering and ranking out resume's.
